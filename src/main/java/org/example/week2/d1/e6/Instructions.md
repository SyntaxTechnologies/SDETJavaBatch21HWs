# Negative Modulus Calculation

## Objective
Learn how to use the modulus operator in Java, especially with a negative dividend.

## Instructions

**Negative Modulus Calculation**

In this project, you will write a small program that calculates the result of a modulus operation where the dividend is negative.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Create an int variable called `dividend` and set it to -21.
    - Create an int variable called `divisor` and set it to 4.

2. **Calculate Modulus**
    - Use the modulus operator to calculate the result of `dividend % divisor` and store the result in a variable called `modulusResult`.

3. **Print the Result**
    - Print the result of the modulus operation in the following format:


## Expected Output
```
-21 mod 4 = -1
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the result.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Modulus Operator**: Use the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of a division operation.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the modulus operator in Java, especially with negative dividends. Happy coding!
