# Shopping Cart Rounding

## Objective
Learn how to use type casting in Java through a practical scenario involving rounding off the total cost of items while shopping.

## Instructions

**Shopping Cart Rounding**

In this project, you will write a small program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, rounds it off to the nearest whole number using type casting, and prints both the original and rounded costs.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
   - Create double variables for the prices of three items: `item1`, `item2`, and `item3`. Assign any values to these variables (e.g., 19.99, 29.75, and 4.99).

2. **Calculate Total Cost**
   - Add the prices of the three items to calculate the total cost and store the result in a variable called `totalCost`.

3. **Round Off Total Cost**
   - Use type casting to convert `totalCost` to an integer value, effectively rounding it down, and store the result in a variable called `roundedCost`.

4. **Print the Results**
   - Print the original total cost and the rounded total cost in the following format:


## Expected Output
```
The original total cost is $54.73
The rounded total cost is $54
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the results.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use type casting to convert the double to an int.

## Additional Information
- **Type Casting**: Type casting is used to convert a variable from one type to another. In this case, from double to int.
- **Double and Int Variables**: A double variable can hold decimal numbers, while an int variable holds whole numbers.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and the type casting is done correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use type casting in Java. Happy coding!
