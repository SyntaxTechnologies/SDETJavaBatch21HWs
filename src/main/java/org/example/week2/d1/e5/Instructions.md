# Pizza Party

## Objective
Learn how to use the modulus operator in Java through a fun and practical scenario.

## Instructions

**Pizza Party**

In this project, you will write a small program that calculates how many pizza slices each person gets at a party and how many slices are left over.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
  - Create an int variable called `totalSlices`. Set it equal to the total number of pizza slices you have (e.g., 13).
  - Create an int variable called `friends`. Set it equal to the number of friends (e.g., 4).

2. **Calculate Slices per Person**
  - Use integer division to calculate how many slices each person gets and store the result in a variable called `slicesPerPerson`.
  - Use the modulus operator to calculate the number of leftover slices and store the result in a variable called `leftoverSlices`.

3. **Print the Results**
  - Print the number of slices each person gets and the number of leftover slices in the following format:


## Expected Output
```
Each person gets 3 slices.
There are 1 slices left over.
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the results.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Modulus Operator**: Use the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of a division operation.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the modulus operator in Java. Happy coding!
