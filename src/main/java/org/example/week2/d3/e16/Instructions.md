# Simple Calculator (If-Else If-Else Conditions)

## Objective
Learn how to use the `if-else if-else` conditions in Java to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

**Simple Calculator**

In this project, you will write a small program that takes an operator and two numbers as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
    - Declare a variable `operator` and assign a value to it (e.g., `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, `"/"`).
    - Declare two variables `num1` and `num2` and assign values to them.

2. **Perform Operation**
    - Use `if-else if-else` statements to check the value of `operator` and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation:
        - If `operator` is `"+"`, print `The sum is: result`.
        - If `operator` is `"-"`, print `The difference is: result`.
        - If `operator` is `"*"`, print `The product is: result`.
        - If `operator` is `"/"`, print `The quotient is: result`.
        - If `operator` is any other value, print `Invalid operator`.

## Expected Output
```
Enter operator (+, -, *, /):
Enter first number:
Enter second number:
The product is: 50.0
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use `if-else if-else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the conditions are checked and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use `if-else if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
