# Classifying Animals by Type

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else-if conditions to classify strings.

## Instructions

**Classifying Animals by Type**

In this project, you will write a small program that classifies animals based on their type using simple if-else-if conditions.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare a Variable**
   - Declare a string variable called `animal`.
   - Assign the value `"dog"` to `animal`.

2. **Classify the Animal**
   - Use simple if-else-if conditions to classify the animal based on its type.
   - If `animal` is `"dog"`, print: `The animal is a mammal.`
   - If `animal` is `"eagle"`, print: `The animal is a bird.`
   - If `animal` is `"shark"`, print: `The animal is a fish.`
   - If `animal` is `"frog"`, print: `The animal is an amphibian.`
   - If `animal` is `"snake"`, print: `The animal is a reptile.`
   - If `animal` does not match any of the above, print: `Unknown animal type.`

## Example Output
```
The animal is a mammal.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Use simple if-else-if conditions to classify the string.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the conditions and print statements are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else-if conditions to classify strings in Java. Happy coding!
