# Temperature Checker (If-Else If-Else Conditions)

## Objective
Learn how to use the `if-else-if ` conditions in Java to determine the temperature status.

## Instructions

**Temperature Checker**

In this project, you will write a small program that checks the temperature and prints a message based on the value.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
   - Declare a variable `temperature` and assign 25 to it.

2. **Check Temperature**
   - Use `if-else-if` statements to check the value of `temperature` and print a message based on the following conditions:
      - If `temperature` is 30 or above, print `"It's hot outside."`.
      - If `temperature` is 20 or above, but less than 30, print `"It's warm outside."`.
      - If `temperature` is 10 or above, but less than 20, print `"It's cool outside."`.
      - If `temperature` is less than 10, print `"It's cold outside."`.

## Expected Output
```
It's warm outside.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use `if-else if-else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the conditions are checked and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use `if-else if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
