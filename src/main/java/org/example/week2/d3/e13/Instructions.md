# Daily Expense Tracker

## Objective
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations and use simple `if-else` conditions.

## Instructions

**Daily Expense Tracker**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns values to daily expenses, calculates the total, and determines if the total expenses are within a specified budget.

**For you to do:**

1. **Assign Daily Expenses**
   - Declare a variable `morningExpense` and assign a value to it.
   - Declare a variable `afternoonExpense` and assign a value to it.
   - Declare a variable `eveningExpense` and assign a value to it.

2. **Calculate Total Expense**
   - Calculate the sum of the three expenses and store it in a variable called `totalExpense`.

3. **Check if Within Budget**
   - Define a budget variable with a value, for example, `budget = 100.0`.
   - Use an `if-else` statement to check if the `totalExpense` is within the budget.

4. **Print the Results**
   - Print the total expense in the format: `"Your total daily expense is: totalExpense"`.
   - Print if the expense is within the budget or over the budget.

## Expected Output
```
Your total daily expense is: 76.25
You are within the budget.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use an `if-else` statement to make decisions based on conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the values are assigned correctly and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use `if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
