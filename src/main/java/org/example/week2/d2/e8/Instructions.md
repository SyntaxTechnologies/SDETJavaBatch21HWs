# Checking Even or Odd Number

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a number is even or odd.

## Instructions

**Checking Even or Odd Number**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns a number to a variable, checks if it is even or odd, and then prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare a Variable**
   - Declare an integer variable called `number`.
   - Assign the value `10` to `number`.

2. **Check if the Number is Even or Odd**
   - Use a simple if-else condition to check if `number` is even.
   - If `number` is even, print: `The number is even.`
   - If `number` is odd, print: `The number is odd.`

## Example Output
```
The number is even.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is even or odd.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the condition and print statements are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a number is even or odd in Java. Happy coding!
