# Checking if a Boolean is True

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else conditions to check the value of a boolean variable.

## Instructions

**Checking if a Boolean is True**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns a boolean value to a variable, checks if it is true, and then prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare a Variable**
   - Declare a boolean variable called `isJavaFun`.
   - Assign the value `true` to `isJavaFun`.

2. **Check if the Boolean is True**
   - Use a simple if-else condition to check if `isJavaFun` is true.
   - If `isJavaFun` is true, print: `Java is fun!`
   - If `isJavaFun` is not true, print: `Java is not fun.`

## Example Output
```
Java is fun!
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Use a simple if-else condition to check the value of the boolean variable.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the condition and print statements are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else conditions to check the value of a boolean variable in Java. Happy coding!
