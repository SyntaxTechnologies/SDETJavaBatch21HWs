# Find the Largest Number

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture numerical input from the user and use nested `if-else` conditions to find the largest number among three distinct numbers.

## Instructions

**Find the Largest Number**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for three distinct numbers and finds the largest number among them using nested `if-else` conditions.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture Three Numbers**
    - Print "Please enter 3 distinct numbers separated by spaces".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store the numbers in three variables called `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.

3. **Find the Largest Number**
    - Use nested `if-else` statements to find the largest number among the three.

## Expected Output
```
Please enter 3 distinct numbers separated by spaces
4 5 14
The largest number is 14
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use nested `if-else` conditions to compare the numbers and find the largest one.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use nested `if-else` statements to make decisions based on multiple conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class and nested `if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
