# Month Name Identifier

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture numerical input from the user and use simple `if-else` conditions to display the corresponding month name.

## Instructions

**Month Name Identifier**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for a month number and displays the corresponding month name. If the user provides a number that is out of the month range (1-12), the program should display "Invalid".

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture Month Number**
    - Print "Please enter the month number".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `monthNumber`.

3. **Identify the Month**
    - Use an `if-else` statement to check the value of `monthNumber`.
    - If the value is between 1 and 12, print the corresponding month name.
    - If the value is out of range, print "Invalid".

## Expected Output
```
Example Output:
Please enter the month number
1
January
Please enter the month number
13
Invalid
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use `if-else` conditions to check the range of `monthNumber`.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use `if-else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class and `if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
